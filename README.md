This repository contains the data files and analysis code used in the manuscript titled "The existence of a priori collective preferential ranking." The data folder contains all of the total 119 subjects' choices and reaction times(RTs) data in the Matlab 'mat' file format.
Below are examples of how to use the functions to find the number of tricksters from the individual and collective preferences using the majority rule. If you load the data file, you can see the two variables, ALLmat and ALLmatRt, which are adjacency matrices for the choices in the 2AFC preferential tasks and their RTs of all 119 subjects: 

```
load ./data/color.mat;
>> whos
  Name          Size               Bytes  Class     Attributes

  ALLmat        8x8x119            60928  double              
  ALLmatRt      8x8x119            60928  double              
```

If you want to investigate the tricksters of the choices performed by the first subject S1 of the total 119 participants, you can use the function to find tricksters, Generator.m:
```
[trickters, NoTrk]=Generator(ALLmat(:,:,1))

trickters =

     1     2     4
     1     2     5
     1     4     8
     1     6     7
     2     4     6
     3     6     7
     4     6     7
     4     6     8


NoTrk =

     3
```
As mentioned in the manuscript, tricksters are defined as a minimal set of alternatives such that the other alternatives could be preferentially ranked. Though tricksters are not uniquely determined, as you see in the above example, their numbers are fixed due to the minimum property.

The study's main finding - the majority's choices have no tricksters - could be checked simply by the following:

```
meanMat=mean(ALLmat,3);
M=makeAdjFromAvgMat(meanMat);
[trickters, NoTrk]=Generator(M)

trickters =

  1Ã—0 empty double row vector


NoTrk =

     0
```
